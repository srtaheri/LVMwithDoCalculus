# INDRA Front Door

This folder contains tools to get all of the front door motifs from INDRA CoGEx
and analyze them.

A front door motif has form `U -> X -> M -> Y <- U` where there are no other
edges between any of U, X, M, and Y.

The data can be generated by running the following in this folder:

```shell
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```
